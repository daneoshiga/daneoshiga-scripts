I have here some small bash scripts that I've made...

limitador.sh
    limit the speed of rtorrent and jdownloader when nobody is using the pc,
    uses xprintidle to check if there's any user activity

playrar.sh
    plays video files inside rar files.

mplayer
    implements "bookmarks" on mplayer, if any bookmark is set, the video will
    continue from that point when played again
