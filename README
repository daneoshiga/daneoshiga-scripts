I have here some small bash scripts that I've made...

conky_startup.sh
    just a wrapper for conky, to delay it's start on boot (which makes it start
    above X)

limitador.sh
    limit the speed of rtorrent and jdownloader when nobody is using the pc,
    uses xprintidle to check if there's any user activity

mplayer
    implements "bookmarks" on mplayer, if any bookmark is set, the video will
    continue from that point when played again

playrar.sh
    plays video files inside rar files.
