I have here some small bash scripts that I've made...

conky_startup.sh
    just a wrapper for conky, to delay it's start on boot (which makes it start
    above X)

limitador.sh
    limit the speed of rtorrent and jdownloader when nobody is using the pc,
    uses xprintidle to check if there's any user activity

mplayer
    implements "bookmarks" on mplayer, if any bookmark is set, the video will
    continue from that point when played again

playrar.sh
    plays video files inside rar files.

mashpodder.sh
    my fork of mashpodder, the shell script podcast downloader, i've added:
        speed limit config for wget
        made it download always the older podcast first
        consider the number of podcasts already on folder in the limit on
        mp.conf, not only for the number of new downloads on that execution.
